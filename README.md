Features:
* Syncs the contacts from multiple CiviCRM groups (regular or smart) to specified Google Groups.
* Adds a scheduled job to automatically sync once per day.
* Requires only one time Authorization, and works based on long lived Refresh Token.
* Supports multiple domains within a Google Apps system.
* An email other than home/work could be used for the sync. Email with location type "Google" is given preference over primary email.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

* PHP v5.6+

## Extension Setup

* Goto Administer >> System Settings >> Google Groups Settings.

* Take a note of the url. This should match with redirect uri setup in OAuth consent screen earlier. If it does not match, edit your oauth consent screen again to correct it.

* Enter client id and secret from the credentials created earlier.

* Enter GSuite domain. For multiple domains enter comma separated domains.

* Save would redirect to google authorization (OAuth) prompt. Once authorized it should redirect back to extension's Google Groups Settings screen. If it does not, either: 
A. Redirect uri has not been setup correctly OR 
B. Your setup is a local one and not accessible to public.

* Once setup, CiviCRM group add or edit screen would render a Google Group dropdown. Select a matching google group. Sync process will make sure that members of google groups are synced from that of matching Civi Group.

* Use Contacts >> Google Groups Sync to run the sync process manually.

* To automate the sync, enable the 'Google Groups Sync (Daily)' job on Administer >> System Settings >> Scheduled Jobs screen.


## Known Issues

Sync is only one way - from CiviCRM to GoogleGroups.
